/**
 * Course: CPE 593-B
 * Project name: homework2.java
 * Author: Tianhao Zhu
 * Description: This class read three string number, then return the gcd, lcm of first two number,
 * and a^b mod r
 * Date: 9/10/2019
 * How to run the code:
 *  - In terminal, or cmd, run:
 *  - "java homework2.java a b r"
 *  - a b r should change to the number you want.
 *  - eg. "java homework2.java 60 3 1231"
